## Overview

During my MSc in Semiconductor Spectroscopy at Tel Aviv University, I designed and built optical microscope systems for advanced spectroscopic measurements. This research resulted in a published paper on time-resolved circularly polarized luminescence.

## Technical Work

### Optical System Design
- Designed microscope setups using Zemax optical design software
- Constructed systems using Thorlabs precision equipment
- Optimized for various spectroscopic measurements

### Hardware Integration
- Integrated photodiodes, piezoelectric stages, and lasers
- Developed custom C code for device control
- Built multithreaded UI in CVI (LabWindows)

### Software Development
- Created data analysis UI using Qt and PyQt
- Implemented real-time data visualization
- Built automated measurement sequences

### Mechanical Design
- Designed laboratory components in Solidworks and Autodesk
- Manufactured custom parts using 3D CAD programs
- Optimized for stability and precision

## Publication
Time-resolved circularly polarized luminescence of Eu3+-based systems
