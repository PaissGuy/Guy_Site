## Overview

At Abili-Tech, I'm developing an innovative system that transforms text into American Sign Language (ASL) using deep learning. This project combines multiple AI technologies to create a seamless translation pipeline.

## Technical Approach

### Encoder-Decoder Architecture
- Designed transformer-based neural network for text-to-gloss conversion
- Implemented attention mechanisms for accurate linguistic mapping
- Optimized model for real-time inference

### Multi-Model Pipeline
- Integrated pretrained NLP models for text processing
- Used pix2pixHD for image-to-image translation
- Implemented body pose estimation for realistic ASL generation

### Development Environment
- Built and tested in Linux/Ubuntu environment
- Leveraged GPU acceleration for training and inference
- Implemented continuous integration for model updates
